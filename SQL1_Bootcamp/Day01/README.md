# Day 01 - Piscine SQL

## Scheme
1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

## Exercise 00 - Let’s make UNION dance

Please write a SQL statement which returns menu’s identifier and pizza names from `menu` table and person’s identifier and person name from `person` table in one global list (with column names as presented on a sample below) ordered by object_id and then by object_name columns.

| object_id | object_name |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Anna |
| 1 | cheese pizza |
| ... | ... |


## Exercise 01 - UNION dance with subquery

Please modify a SQL statement from “exercise 00” by removing the object_id column. Then change ordering by object_name for part of data from the `person` table and then from `menu` table (like presented on a sample below). Please save duplicates!

| object_name |
| ------ |
| Andrey |
| Anna |
| ... |
| cheese pizza |
| cheese pizza |
| ... |


## Exercise 02 - Duplicates or not duplicates

Please write a SQL statement which returns unique pizza names from the `menu` table and orders by pizza_name column in descending mode.

## Exercise 03 - “Hidden” Insights

Please write a SQL statement which returns common rows for attributes order_date, person_id from `person_order` table from one side and visit_date, person_id from `person_visits` table from the other side (please see a sample below). In other words, let’s find identifiers of persons, who visited and ordered some pizza on the same day. Actually, please add ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode.

| action_date | person_id |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | 6 |
| 2022-01-01 | 2 |
| 2022-01-01 | 1 |
| 2022-01-03 | 7 |
| 2022-01-04 | 3 |
| ... | ... |


## Exercise 04 - Difference? Yep, let's find the difference between multisets.

Please write a SQL statement which returns a difference (minus) of person_id column values with saving duplicates between `person_order` table and `person_visits` table for order_date and visit_date are for 7th of January of 2022

## Exercise 05 - Did you hear about Cartesian Product?

Please write a SQL statement which returns all possible combinations between `person` and `pizzeria` tables and please set ordering by person identifier and then by pizzeria identifier columns. Please take a look at the result sample below. Please be aware column's names can be different for you.

| person.id | person.name | age | gender | address | pizzeria.id | pizzeria.name | rating |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Anna | 16 | female | Moscow | 1 | Pizza Hut | 4.6 |
| 1 | Anna | 16 | female | Moscow | 2 | Dominos | 4.3 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


## Exercise 06 - Lets see on “Hidden” Insights

Let's return our mind back to exercise #03 and change our SQL statement to return person names instead of person identifiers and change ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_name in descending mode. Please take a look at a data sample below.

| action_date | person_name |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Irina |
| 2022-01-01 | Anna |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey |
| ... | ... |

## Exercise 07 - Just make a JOIN

Please write a SQL statement which returns the date of order from the `person_order` table and corresponding person name (name and age are formatted as in the data sample below) which made an order from the `person` table. Add a sort by both columns in ascending mode.

| order_date | person_information |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey (age:21) |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey (age:21) |
| 2022-01-01 | Anna (age:16) |
| ... | ... |

## Exercise 08 - Migrate JOIN to NATURAL JOIN

Please rewrite a SQL statement from exercise #07 by using NATURAL JOIN construction. The result must be the same like for exercise #07.  

## Exercise 09 - IN versus EXISTS

Please write 2 SQL statements which return a list of pizzerias names which have not been visited by persons by using IN for 1st one and EXISTS for the 2nd one.

## Exercise 10 - Global JOIN

Please write a SQL statement which returns a list of the person names which made an order for pizza in the corresponding pizzeria.    
The sample result (with named columns) is provided below and yes ... please make ordering by 3 columns (`person_name`, `pizza_name`, `pizzeria_name`) in ascending mode.

| person_name | pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Andrey | cheese pizza | Dominos |
| Andrey | mushroom pizza | Dominos |
| Anna | cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... | ... |
